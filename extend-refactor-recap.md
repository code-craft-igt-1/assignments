# Recap of extensions

## Data structures to store messages

[Mapping enums](https://github.com/code-craft-igt-1/simple-monitor-in-cpp-manojsubrahmanian/blob/4608a4b1a075490f65140a06ffda5989e90b6a32/vitals_messages.h)

[Mapping strings](https://github.com/code-craft-igt-1/simple-monitor-in-cpp-Lokesh-Kumar-121/blob/ef5f17a648f3fbb7a3ce6390970fcce0f5600b0b/monitor.cpp)

## Common comment

In most repos, the strings aren't automatically tested.
Also, it's hard to test all the situations in all the languages manually each time.
Of course, the "understand-ability" of the translation can only be confirmed manually by native speakers.
But other things can go wrong, like missing a translation in a particular language, etc.

>Can you think of any asserts to safeguard against that?

## Thresholds

[Declarative code to express requirements](https://github.com/code-craft-igt-1/simple-monitor-in-cpp-manojsubrahmanian/blob/4608a4b1a075490f65140a06ffda5989e90b6a32/vitals_monitor.h)
